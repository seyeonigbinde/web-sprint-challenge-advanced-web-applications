Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.


1. Explain what a token is used for.

A token is a string of cryptic text which can be stored in the client-side using local storage or session storage. It is a vital player in securing our application. Token based authentication works by ensuring that each request to a server is accompanied by a signed token which the server verifies for authenticity and only then responds to the request.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

Authentication is the best way to secure our data. Authentication is the process for identifying user identity which leads to authorization that is the process of determining the access and permissions of a user. By this, unauthorized users cannot have access to our data.

3. Describe how web servers work.

Web servers can mean a computer that stores the code for a website or a program that runs on such a computer. When a user's browser request HTML file from a web server, the server respond very quickly with simple HTML file with styles and scripts linked. The main purpose of the web server is to "serve" web pages it retrieves from the code to the users upon request.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

C - POST - to insert data
R - GET - to read data
U - PUT - to update data
D - DELETE - to delete data
